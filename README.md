Foundational concepts in APIs
---
### **API:**  
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows software applications to communicate with each other.\
**For example,** a weather app uses an API to fetch weather data from a weather service.   

### **SDK:**  
An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of tools and resources for building applications on a specific platform.\
**For example,** the Android SDK provides tools for developing Android apps.   

### **Web APIs:** 
Web APIs are APIs that are accessed over the internet using HTTP.\
**For example,** the Google Maps API allows developers to embed Google Maps into their websites.   

### **Library APIs:**
Library APIs are APIs provided by software libraries, which are collections of pre-written code.\
**For example,** the NumPy library in Python provides APIs for numerical operations.   

### **Prompting and Completion:**
Prompting involves providing input to a language model to guide its output, while completion is the model's generated output based on the prompt.\
**For example,** in the prompt "Once upon a time," the model might complete the sentence with "there was a princess."
